This is a repo containing the codes that I implement for Gibb's Sampling for n-d dimensions.
Current Update : Code for Gibb's Sampling for Bayesian Linear Regression is uploaded and code for Gibb's Sampling Polynomail Regreesion is being implemented.

1. Bayesian Linear Regression: 

    y = N(beta_0 + beta_1 * x, 1/T) where N is a normal distribution and T(tau) is the precision.
    Deriving formulas for updating beta_0, beta_1 and tau and implementing them in their functions help update and converge to the true values of them in the distribution.
